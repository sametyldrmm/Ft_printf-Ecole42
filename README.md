# Ft_printf - Ecole 42 Project

This repository contains the solution to the ft_printf project, part of the curriculum at Ecole 42.

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to create a function called ft_printf, which is a re-implementation of the standard library function `printf`. The function should have the same behavior as the original `printf` function, but should be written from scratch without using any of the standard library functions. This project will help you understand the intricacies of the `printf` function and reinforce your understanding of the C programming language.

## My Introduction
The ft_printf project is a simple yet important project that can provide a good answer to the question of why we need to pay attention to the basics of software and why we need to use the struct structure to understand countless variables. The main goal of this project is to create a direct printf. Of course, we won't be able to be as fast as the real printf even if we want to. Existing rules are a barrier to this.

## Usage
To use the ft_printf function, simply include the header file `ft_printf.h` in your code and call the function as you would with `printf`. For example:

```
#include "ft_printf.h"

int main(void)
{
    ft_printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}

```
## Key Features
- Support for various data types such as `char`, `int`, `float`, and `pointer`
- Support for flags such as `-`, `+`, `0`, `space`, and `#`
- Support for field width and precision
- Support for conversion specifiers, including `d`, `i`, `o`, `u`, `x`, `X`, `f`, `c`, `s`, and `p`



## Tips for First-Time Ecole 42 Students
- Make sure to complete the bonus parts of the project, as it will help you develop your coding skills more thoroughly. If you skip the bonus parts, you may miss out on the opportunity to gain valuable experience in the basics of software development.

- Try to complete the project without using the struct data structure, to gain a deeper understanding of when and how it is used.

- Maintain a balance of knowledge and experience by testing your code at every step.

- Challenge yourself by testing against the most difficult testers, and don't be afraid to ask for help or share your experience with other students, even if you don't receive full marks on the testers.

- Don't hesitate to redo the project multiple times. Doing so will help you to better understand the structure of the project, and will also allow you to see how much faster you can complete it with each iteration.

## Useful Websites for Reference
- https://cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/printf/
- https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/variadic/va_arg
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4316314/pass-struct-by-reference-in-c
These three websites should provide sufficient information and support to understand and complete the project.


## Conclusion
I hope this project was a valuable experience for me and I learned a lot about how printf works and how to recreate it. I also encourage others to try and recreate this project as well, as it will give you a better understanding of the code and how it works.
